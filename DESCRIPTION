Description: 
    POMA introduces a structured, reproducible and easy-to-use workflow for the visualization, pre-processing, 
    exploratory and statistical analysis of mass spectrometry data. The main aim of POMA is to enable a flexible 
    data cleaning and statistical analysis processes in one comprehensible and user-friendly R package. This package also 
    has a Shiny app version that implements all POMA functions. See https://github.com/pcastellanoescuder/POMAShiny.
